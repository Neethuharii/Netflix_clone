# Netflix Clone React Js

This project is a Netflix clone created using React.js. The idea behind this project was to make everything static (movies, series, tv shows, ...), but then I found the really cool TMDB API which allowed me to pull most popular movies, top-rated shows, what's trending, collections, lists, and much more. I used the Axios library to fetch the API details.

## Features

- Fetches movie and TV show data from the TMDB API
- Displays the most popular movies, top-rated shows, trending, and more
- When you click on a movie or show, it will show the YouTube trailer of the show.


## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Axios
